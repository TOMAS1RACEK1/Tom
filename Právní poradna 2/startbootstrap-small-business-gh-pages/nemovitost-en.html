 <p> 
    In the field of real estate – i.e., land, houses, apartments, recreational properties, etc. – I have long been involved in both contentious matters and helping clients contractually secure their requirements regarding all types of real estate and all types of relationships that may arise in connection with such real estate.
 </p> 
 
 <p>
    Here you can order a publication dealing with <a href="https://www.beck.cz/sousedska-prava" target="_blank">Neighborhood rights</a>.
</p> 

<p>
        When it comes to contentious matters, I can offer my long-term experience in representing clients in often very complicated legal disputes concerning ownership and co-ownership of real estate, including issues of adverse possession, invalidity of contracts, return of gifts, etc.

</p>

<p>
    When it comes to contractual security of legal relationships concerning real estate, I deal with transfers of ownership and co-ownership, including comprehensive legal services – purchase, sale, donation, exchange, as well as easements (or servitudes), liens and preemptive rights, as well as the termination and settlement of co-ownership – see also the separate section on property settlement.
</p>

<p>
    Representation in proceedings before cadastral authorities is a matter of course.
</p> 

<p>
    Part of my legal services includes verifying the authenticity of signatures on documents, which allows for greater flexibility in providing legal services. If necessary, I am able to arrange for signature verification outside my office.
</p> 


<p>
    If the client so requires, I can also offer to hold the purchase price in a separate "lawyer's escrow account" and subsequently pay this escrowed purchase price to the seller.
</p> 

<p>
    You may be asking yourself why you should even contact a law firm about a property you want to purchase or, conversely, transfer to another person as a gift or for consideration, when there are many different templates available on the internet or a friend has a completely reliable universal template for a transfer agreement for any property on their computer. The question is what you require: certainty of the entire transfer, or are you willing to accept a risky undertaking that could have a very unpleasant impact on your life and that of your loved ones in the years to come?
</p> 

<p>
    Anyone who requires complete certainty regarding the entire transfer should choose to have the real estate transfer agreement fully drafted by a lawyer, i.e., an attorney or notary. As an attorney with many years of experience, I believe that I offer legal quality, certainty, and a guarantee even after registration in the land registry—I draft agreements in their entirety and vouch for them. The internet is full of sample real estate transfer agreements, for which you pay either nothing at all or only a symbolic price, but on the other hand, they are either not guaranteed at all or only to a limited extent, i.e., for the sample as such, but not for the result after incorrect completion or incorrect use for a specific situation. In practice, these issues are unfortunately repeatedly underestimated.
</p> 

<p>
    Of course, I also offer review and revision of existing contracts. If you already have a draft purchase agreement submitted by the other party or a real estate agency, I can review it, point out any risks, and revise the provisions to better protect you. Even a transfer through a real estate agency may not guarantee a smooth transfer without your review. Neither a real estate agency, appraisal office, surveying office, nor any other similar entity or person is responsible for the validity and legal quality of a real estate transfer agreement, even if they have experience with such agreements.
</p> 

<p>
    If a real estate agency submits a transfer agreement as part of a brokered transaction, you should definitely be interested in whether the agreement was prepared by a lawyer or a broker (a broker is a real estate agent who, unfortunately, does not have any mandatory qualifications or educational requirements under Czech law). Given the value of real estate, it is definitely worthwhile to have the agreement, if not drafted, at least reviewed and, if necessary, revised by your chosen legal representative.
