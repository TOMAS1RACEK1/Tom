    Inheritance proceedings following the death of family members are one of the sad aspects of life and are often associated with considerable stress and emotion. I am prepared to provide you with assistance and representation if you become involved in inheritance proceedings.
 </p>

<p>
    Probate proceedings take place before a notary acting as a judicial commissioner appointed by the district court (in Prague, the municipal court) in whose jurisdiction the deceased had their last place of residence. In most probate proceedings, the presence of a lawyer is probably unnecessary, but there are an increasing number of cases where representation of the heir by a lawyer is absolutely essential.
</p>

<p>
    Particularly complex cases arise when there are multiple heirs who cannot agree on the distribution of the inheritance, especially in situations where death occurs suddenly and the deceased did not remember to write their last will and testament. This leads to family disputes that revive long-forgotten conflicts and family grievances. Or, conversely, the deceased remembered to write a last will and testament, but—whether consciously or unconsciously—failed to name you in it and bequeathed their property to more distant relatives or mere acquaintances.
</p>

<p>
    Sometimes, such last wills and testaments are not entirely clear, definite, or comprehensible, and the circumstances under which they were written may be unclear or even suspicious. You may even find that your own father or mother expressly disinherits you in their last will and testament, i.e., excludes you from inheriting from them, often for false or distorted reasons. This opens up the possibility of asserting your right to inheritance. If you do not know your rights or how to enforce them, it is easy for a more experienced or better-informed heir, often represented by a lawyer, to gain an undeserved financial advantage at your expense, which is unnecessary. Many such situations can be dealt with, and I will be happy to provide you with my services and assistance in this area.
</p>

<p>
   Not all of us leave this world wealthy. It may happen that our relative was poor and left behind almost nothing from a legal standpoint, but then we must be even more careful: we must ensure that the inheritance is not burdened with unpleasant debts, such as social security, pension, and health insurance payments, debts to business partners, housing, telephone, hospital stay, etc. In such a case, you may find yourself "inheriting" from your ancestor the obligation to pay debts even beyond the scope of the inheritance you have actually acquired. Nevertheless, the heir can defend himself. In addition to the basic option of refusing the inheritance, he can, for example, request a so-called inventory of the estate in good time. However, it is necessary for him to be aware of these options and to know their exact meaning.
</p>

<p>
    Testament<br>
</p>

<p>
    The Civil Code stipulates that the will of the testator (deceased) should be the key criterion for assessing dispositions of property upon death, so that the testator has the opportunity during his or her lifetime to actually decide what will happen to his or her property after death.
</p> 

<p>
     A lawyer can help you decide what legal form to give to this decision or help you draw up such a document in case of your death.
</p>

<p>
    The will, i.e. the "last will and testament" of the deceased, has the highest legal force in inheritance proceedings. In addition to the will, the Civil Code also recognizes inheritance contracts and bequests. If there is no will or other provision for the event of death, or if not all assets are included in it, inheritance by law comes into play. Direct descendants and spouses are preferred. However, regardless of the content of the will, the so-called mandatory heirs, i.e. the descendants of the deceased, must receive their "mandatory share." A minor descendant is entitled to three-quarters of the share they would receive under statutory inheritance (if there were no will). An adult descendant is now only entitled to one-quarter of the statutory inheritance share.
</p>

<p>
    A will must be in writing (except for exceptions specified by law, such as war or natural disasters). However, the law does not generally require a will to be notarized in order to be valid, although this is a recommended option.
</p>

<p>
   There are three types of wills, namely:
</p>


    1. HOLOGRAPHIC WILL – the testator writes it by hand, dates it, and signs it (without a notary or other witnesses).<br>
    2. HANDWRITTEN WILL – written by someone other than the testator, signed by the testator in their own hand in front of two witnesses who are present at the same time.<br>
    3. A WILL DRAFTED IN THE FORM OF A NOTARIAL RECORD.<br>
    

    <p>
    If there is no will (or inheritance contract), or if it does not cover all assets, inheritance by law comes into play. The Civil Code divides potential heirs into six inheritance classes.
</p>

<p>
    The testator's children and spouse, who belong to the so-called first class of heirs, have priority and each inherit an equal share. If a child does not inherit, his or her children acquire his or her share of the inheritance in equal parts. If the deceased has no descendants, the second class of heirs includes the spouse, the deceased's parents, and those who lived with the deceased in a shared household for at least one year prior to his or her death and who, for this reason, took care of the shared household or were dependent on the deceased for support. The spouse is always entitled to at least half of the estate. If the members of one group do not inherit, the inheritance passes to the next group. The aim is to ensure that the property remains within the circle of the deceased's closest relatives as far as possible and that only in very exceptional cases is it inherited by the state.
</p>

<p>
    However, the testator may disinherit some of the descendants and thus deprive them of the compulsory share that would otherwise belong to them by law. 
</p>

   <p>
    Disinheritance is only possible if at least one of the reasons specified by law is met:
</p>  

<p>
    1. the descendant did not provide assistance in old age,<br>
    2. does not show genuine interest in a relative, as he should<br>
    3. was sentenced to imprisonment for an intentional crime committed under circumstances indicating his depraved nature,<br>
    4. leads a permanently disorderly life,<br>
    5. is ineligible to inherit and is therefore excluded from inheritance rights, or<br>
    6. is so indebted or behaves so wastefully that there is concern that the compulsory portion will not be preserved for his descendants.<br>
