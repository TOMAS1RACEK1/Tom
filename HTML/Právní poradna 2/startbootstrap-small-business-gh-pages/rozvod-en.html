    <h1 class="centered-title">Divorce</h1> 
    <div class="text-container">
 <p>  
    Divorce can be very emotionally draining; it is one of the most stressful situations you can encounter in life. You often need someone's help, advice, and support. If you are deciding whether to end your marriage through divorce, or if your partner has already made that decision, then you will face legal proceedings, because only a court with local and subject-matter jurisdiction can grant a divorce. I can explain what to expect, what requirements the court will impose on you, and I can not only provide you with the necessary information, but also guide you through the entire process.
</p>

<p>
   There are two ways to get a divorce in the Czech Republic:
</p> 

<p>
   <li> CONTESTED DIVORCE – with investigation into the causes of the breakdown of the marriage.</li> 
   </p> 
   
   <p>
    <li>UNDISPUTED DIVORCE (contractual) – without investigating the causes of the breakdown of the marriage.</li>
</p>

    <p>
    In the first case, the court will only grant a divorce if the marriage is so deeply, permanently, and irreparably broken that there is no prospect of reconciliation. It is up to the petitioner (plaintiff) to prove this breakdown, which is often neither pleasant nor easy.
</p>

<p>
    Divorce without determining the causes of marital breakdown, i.e. the second option for divorce under Czech law, is often referred to as divorce by mutual consent or contractual divorce. Contractual divorce is possible if the conditions required by law are met.
</p>

<p>
    In such a "contractual divorce," the spouses must agree in advance on the division of property, alimony, the manner in which minor children will be cared for, and, last but not least, they must meet all formal requirements—among other things, a condition of such a procedure is that the spouses have not lived together for at least six months and their marriage has lasted at least one year.
</p>

<p>
    Even under the new Civil Code, the proposal for a "contractual divorce" by one spouse must be joined by the other spouse. In other words, if you want to divorce amicably and not "air your dirty laundry" in court (i.e., not prove the causes of the breakdown of the marriage), you must submit to the divorce court a written agreement between both spouses that is validly concluded and complies with all requirements regarding the settlement of joint property, the spouses' housing after the divorce, as well as an agreement on the care of your children, including the amount of alimony.
</p> 

<p>
    It follows from the above that the path to divorce is relatively long – sometimes easier and shorter, sometimes more difficult and longer, especially if there are minor children in the marriage, because before the divorce itself, the circumstances of minor children for the period after the divorce must be arranged – see the separate link children and the law. You are divorced only when you have a written copy of the court's divorce decree in your hands and this decision is final (i.e., among other things, it can no longer be appealed)..
</p>

<p>
    If you did not divorce by mutual agreement, i.e. if you did not conclude an agreement on the settlement of your joint property before the divorce, then after the marriage has ended, i.e. after the divorce, it is necessary to resolve the material issues related to the divorce – see the separate link on property settlement.
</p>

<p>
    For the sake of completeness, it should be noted that a divorced wife (or husband) may revert to her former surname after divorce, up to six months after the divorce – until December 31, 2013, according to the original Family Act No. 94/1963 Coll. it was only possible to change one's surname within one month of the end of the marriage.
