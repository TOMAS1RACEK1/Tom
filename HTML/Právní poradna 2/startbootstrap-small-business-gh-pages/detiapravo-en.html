 <p>  
Children and parents have rights and obligations towards each other that they cannot waive or renounce. These rights are currently defined primarily by the new Civil Code and the International Convention on the Rights of the Child. Among other things, children have the right not only to know their parents, but also to be raised by them, they have the right to a standard of living necessary for their development (and the right to share the standard of living of their parents) and to education. 
 
 </p>

 <p>
In practice, these rights and obligations most often need to be addressed when the child's parents separate, whether they are unmarried partners or married. How each parent will care for the child after the divorce must be determined by the court before the divorce itself. The decision must always be made with the child's best interests in mind.

</p> 

<p>
Parents have a duty to support their child if they are unable to support themselves, and therefore, in the event of a separation, it is necessary to determine how and to what extent the parents will contribute to the child's maintenance. If you no longer have joint or alternating custody of the child, it is also necessary to determine when you will have contact with your child. These issues are decided by the court, and even if you agree on these issues with your former partner or spouse, the agreement must be approved by the court (i.e., the agreement must go through court proceedings) in order to be enforceable.

</p> 

<p>
If you need advice on these issues, I will be happy to help you or guide you through the court process. I am prepared to draft a parental agreement on the care of your child according to your needs, which will reflect the needs and possibilities of both your child and parents, while also satisfying the court.
Unfortunately, agreement is often not possible. Especially in matters of parenting, parents today emphasize that both the mother and father have equal rights. Therefore, it is increasingly common for parents to seek so-called alternating custody, even against the will of the other parent. The jurisprudence of the Constitutional Court of the Czech Republic is responding flexibly to this trend.
</p> 

<p>
How will it be after <a href="rozvod-en.html" target="_blank">divorce</a> (or after the separation of unmarried partners) has the custody of your child been resolved?
The child may be entrusted either to the sole custody of one parent, to alternating custody, or to the sole custody of both parents. 
</p> 

<p>
In cases of sole custody, the child lives with the mother or father, but the parent with whom the child does not live has the right to have contact with the child. Contact between the parent and the child can vary greatly in scope, with the minimum scope being a standard weekend every two weeks. The parent with whom the child does not live fulfills their maintenance obligation by paying child support until the child is able to support themselves (i.e., not only until they reach a certain age, such as 18) – see the separate section on child support.

</p> 

<p>
A minor child who is not fully legally competent is entitled to child support even if they have their own property (e.g., acquired through inheritance), but the income from that property, together with income from gainful employment, is not sufficient to support them. It is possible to agree on a different frequency of maintenance payments than monthly installments, but monthly maintenance payments have always been and will probably remain the most common form of payment. Child support can be awarded retroactively for up to three years, and interest on arrears can also be claimed.

</p> 

<p>
In alternating custody, the child lives alternately with the mother for a specific, precisely defined period of time and with the father for a specific, precisely defined period of time, with each parent living elsewhere (i.e., the parents do not live together). In practice, the alternation usually takes place every week or every 14 days, but shared custody can also take place on an irregular basis, in shorter periods of time. In the case of shared custody, child support is determined by both parents, but in the case of diametrically different income levels, it is possible that only the parent who earns more will pay child support. This form of parenting is still a highly debated institution, but it is increasingly being favored and applied by Czech courts, although, of course, sole custody, usually with the mother, still prevails.
</p> 

<p>
In joint custody, the child continues to live with both parents. This usually occurs in situations where divorced spouses continue to live in one large house after the divorce (e.g., each on a different floor) and therefore no one moves out—neither the child nor the parents. However, there are other possible scenarios. The prerequisite is that communication between the parents is so smooth that even after the divorce, they are able to provide for the child's needs and care for them in the same way as before the divorce or separation. In joint custody, it sometimes happens that the child does not even realize that their parents have divorced or separated. The child is cared for by both the father and mother together, just as before the divorce, and child support is not usually determined. Unlike sole custody and alternating custody, joint custody cannot be chosen against the will of the other parent.

<p>
In addition to the above-mentioned issues of upbringing, nutrition, and parent-child contact, you may find yourself having to resolve certain other issues through the courts as a parent, which I encounter as a lawyer:
</p> 

<p>
– replacement of the consent or refusal of the other parent by a court decision (e.g., consent to the choice of school, change of residence, vaccination, etc.)<br>
– change of surname or first name of a minor child,<br>
– termination of parental responsibility,<br>
– adoption of a child,<br>
– return of the child</p>
